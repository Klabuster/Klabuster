ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Klabuster, and I like flying below the radar, so this is my "incognito" / for fun account.
Also, I will use it to post and communicate about issues in some spheres here and report bugs.

I'm quite good in coding C / C++ /Â ASM x86 /Â ASM AVR RISC, but mostly in embedded, bare-metal works, like plain code (get headaches with extreme macro / template usages) and pointer arithmetics..
I maintain quite a hate relationship with untyped / dynamically typed languages like JS &Â Co., most "web" stuff, but love some of the modern, often well-engineered approaches of Smalltalk, Haxe, D and Ring, especially when there's a focus on beautiful (but still practical, logical) code _and_ high efficiency.

Born and raised as a computer nerd kid in 81, I also got an intense fascination for analog electronics and devices with well-made moving parts and mechanisms in the age of 5, which is why analog circuits is one of my most flourishing time sinks of the last 1.5 decades.

No matter how you found your way over to me:
Thanks, but I'm not open for comissions.
